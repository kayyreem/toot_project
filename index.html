            <p>Commuters Globally & SA in particular, are impacted by an alarming rate of accidents, caused by belligerent behavior (i.e. reckless, distracted & intoxicated driving, uninsured drivers etc) consequently causing fatalities on their daily commute to school, work or enroute to destinations of leisure, which pose a significant threat to transport safety & communities. Looking specifically South Africa, a significant burden placed  on the SA economy 3.29% GDP, valued at approximately R198 Billion (2021/22) in an Economy that grew by 1.9% in 2022.<br>
            <h2>The Toot-way</h2>
            Our proposal, forms part of an open-access digital transport-management solution, where a community of users use technology to <strong>"Toot"</strong> wreckless drivers out, mitigating behavior-related incidents, before they become bigger consequences of frustrations, like road-rage, accidents & worst-case, fatalities incurred on our roads. 
            <br><br>
            Our Software that will be the intermediary agency between the following market participants/users:<br> 
            <strong>Commuters:</strong><li> Private vehicle owners, (Motorised & Non-motorised), Cyclers, tourists, students, public transport, disabled persons (physical & hearing), elderly persons</li><br>
            <strong>Commercial Automotive sector:</strong><li>Secondary Market (Parts suppliers) & Tertiary providers (Mechanic-services, Fleet managers,  Insurance providers, Last-mile delivery services.</li> <br>
            <strong> Public sector:</strong> <li>Transport & Fleet Operators</li> <br>
            <strong>Law enforcement agencies:</strong><li>Municipal, Regional & National Police & Traffic enforcement agencies</li><br>  
            <br>
            The long term goal is to feed into an advanced transport management system that can provide real-time insights on how Road Users with different interests ie Commuters, Transport Operators, Commercial, Private & Law enforcements, engage transparently in the Transport ecosystem, to transpose with incidents over geo-spacial data to identify hotspots bottlenecks, frustrating incidents & correlate crime with infrastructure deficiencies & advocating on infrastructure developments based on credible data.</p>
