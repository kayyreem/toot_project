            <h2>a State of Emergency on South Africa's Roads!</h2>
            <p>Commuters Globally & SA in particular, are impacted by an alarming rate of accidents, caused by  behaviorial factors (i.e. excessive speeding, distracted & intoxicated driving, intoxicated pedestrians, jay-walking etc) consequently causing fatalities on their daily commute to school, work or enroute to destinations of leisure, which poses a significant threat to safety & securuity of communities.<br>
            <br>Of the 10 466 recorded fatal crashes in 2022, this resulted in 12 436 fatailties, which is an average of 34-lives lost on the roads daily. From an economic stand-point, the burden on the SA economy cost approximately 3.5% of GDP, valued at <strong>R198.79 Billion (2021/22) </strong> <a href="https://www.rtmc.co.za/images/rtmc/docs/reports/RTMC-Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf">RTMC 2022/23 Anuual Report</a></strong> in an Economy that grew by <strong>1.9% in 2022.</strong></p>
            
            <h2>The Toot-way</h2>
            <p>Our primary goal is to meaningfully contribute a technological approach towards <strong>decreasing Road-Fatalities across African roads</strong> with the various road-users.
                <br>Our secondary objectives forms part of efforts towards democratizing access to digital transport-management solution, where the Commuters use technology to <strong>"Toot-out"</strong>  dangerous road-behaviors, unsafe vehicles & situations that compromise their safety, as  passengers, pedestrians or by-standers, to mitigate behavior-related incidents, before they become consequences of frustrations, like road-rage, intolerance, accidents & worst-case, fatalities incurred on our roads.
                <br>Lastly, we aim to <strong>bolster the law enforcement agencies capacity</strong> to tackle non-compliant behaviors, be proactive in addressing belligerent drivers & intercept other reported incidents before they become accidents & fatalities, efficiently.</p>
            
            <p>Our Software that will be the intermediary agency between the following road-users:</p> 
            <strong>Civil Society:</strong><ul>
                <li>Private vehicles (Motorised & Non-motorised), Tourists, Pedestrians, Public Transport Commuters & the Special needs community (physical & hearing)</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Industry & Business</strong><ul>
                <li>Secondary Market (Parts suppliers) & Tertiary providers: Mechanic-services, Fleet managers, Insurance providers, Last-mile delivery services.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong> Public sector:</strong><ul>
                <li>Transport & Fleet Operators</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Law enforcement agencies:</strong><ul>
                <li>Municipal/Regional & National Traffic with mandates of crime-prevention, combating, visibile policing & enforcement functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The long term goal is to feed into an advanced transport management system that provides real-time insights on how  different Road-Users ie Commuters, Transport Operators, Commercial, Private & Law enforcements, interact transparently within the Transport ecosystem.<br>By leveraging community generated data & geo-spacial tags we'll be able to generate new insight identifying hotspots, bottlenecks, trends regarding when, how & where these frustrating incidents & crime occur, and how they contribute towards the fatalties on the roads. Identifying infrastructure deficiencies & advocating on infrastructure developments based open-access credible data.<br>
            <br>We've included a link to the latest <a href="https://www.dpme.gov.za/keyfocusareas/outcomesSite/MTSF_2019_2024/Final%20Revised%20MTSF%202019-2024%202021.pdf">Medium-Term-Strategic_Framework-2019/24</a> a 5-year document outlining the implementation plan of the 2030 NDP goals. It's a supporting document, highlighting the need of a collaborative & technological effort towards achieving some of the key UN SDG's, AU goals & NRSS goals, in decreasing the Fatalities on roads by 50% in 2030,  supported by various policy instruments.</p>
