            <h2>There's a State of Emergency on South Africa's Roads!</h2>
            <p>Commuters Globally & SA in particular, are impacted by an alarming rate of accidents, caused by belligerent behaviorial factors (i.e. reckless, distracted & intoxicated driving, underage drivers etc) consequently causing fatalities on their daily commute to school, work or enroute to destinations of leisure, which pose a significant threat to transport safety & communities. Looking specifically South Africa, a significant burden placed  on the SA economy 3.29% GDP, valued at approximately <strong>R198 Billion (2021/22)</strong> in an Economy that grew by <strong>1.9% in 2022</strong>.</p>
            
            <h2>The Toot-way</h2>
            <p>Our primary goal is to meaningfully contribute towards <strong>decreasing Road-Fatalities across African roads</strong>. Our secondary objectives forms part of an open-access digital transport-management solution, where a community of users use technology to <strong>"Toot-out"</strong>  wreckless driving-behaviors, unsafe vehicles & situation that compromised their individual & collective safety, to mitigate behavior-related incidents, before they become bigger consequences of frustrations, like road-rage, intolerance, accidents & worst-case, fatalities incurred on our roads.</p>
            
            <p>Our Software that will be the intermediary agency between the following market participants/users:</p> 
            <strong>Civil Society:</strong><ul>
                <li>Private vehicles (Motorised & Non-motorised), Tourists, Students, Public Transport, Special needs community (physical & hearing) & the Elderly community.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Business & Industry</strong><ul>
                <li>Secondary Market (Parts suppliers) & Tertiary providers: Mechanic-services, Fleet managers, Insurance providers, Last-mile delivery services.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong> Public sector:</strong><ul>
                <li>Transport & Fleet Operators</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Law enforcement agencies:</strong><ul>
                <li>Municipal/Regional & National Traffic with mandates of crime-prevention, combating, visibile policing & enforcement functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The long term goal is to feed into an advanced transport management system that provides real-time insights on how  different Road-Users ie Commuters, Transport Operators, Commercial, Private & Law enforcements, interact transparently within the Transport ecosystem. Leveraging on community generated data, over geo-spacial data, identifying hotspots, bottlenecks, trends regarding when, how & where these frustrating incidents & crime occur, and how they contribute towards the fatalties on the roads. Identifying infrastructure deficiencies & advocating on infrastructure developments based open-access credible data.<br>
            <br>We've included a link to the latest <a href="https://www.dpme.gov.za/keyfocusareas/outcomesSite/MTSF_2019_2024/Final%20Revised%20MTSF%202019-2024%202021.pdf">Medium-Term-Strategic_Framework-2019/24</a> a 5-year document outlining the implementation plan of the 2030 NDP goals. It's a supporting document, highlighting the need of a collaborative & technological effort towards achieving some of the key UN SDG's, AU goals & NRSS goals, in decreasing the Fatalities on roads by 50% in 2030,  supported by various policy instruments.</p>
