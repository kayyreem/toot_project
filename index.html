            <p>Commuters Globally & SA in particular, are impacted by an alarming rate of accidents, caused by belligerent behavior (i.e. reckless, distracted & intoxicated driving, underage drivers etc) consequently causing fatalities on their daily commute to school, work or enroute to destinations of leisure, which pose a significant threat to transport safety & communities. Looking specifically South Africa, a significant burden placed  on the SA economy 3.29% GDP, valued at approximately R198 Billion (2021/22) in an Economy that grew by 1.9% in 2022.</p>
            
            <h2>The Toot-way</h2>
            <p>Our proposal, forms part of an open-access digital transport-management solution, where a community of users use technology to <strong>"Toot-out"</strong>  wreckless driving-behaviors, unsafe vehicles & situation that compromised their individual & collective safety, to mitigate behavior-related incidents, before they become bigger consequences of frustrations, like road-rage, intolerance, accidents & worst-case, fatalities incurred on our roads.</p>
            
            <p>Our Software that will be the intermediary agency between the following market participants/users:</p> 
            <strong>Civil society:</strong><ul>
                <li>Private vehicles, (Motorised & Non-motorised), tourists, students, public transport, disabled persons (physical & hearing), elderly persons.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Business & Industry</strong><ul>
                <li>Secondary Market (Parts suppliers) & Tertiary providers: Mechanic-services, Fleet managers, Insurance providers, Last-mile delivery services.</li>
            </ul>
            <strong> Public sector:</strong><ul>
                <li>Transport & Fleet Operators</li>
            </ul>
            <strong>Law enforcement agencies:</strong><ul>
                <li>Municipal/Regional & National Traffic with mandates of crime-prevention, combating, visibile policing & enforcement functions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The long term goal is to feed into an advanced transport management system that can provide real-time insights on how Road Users with different interests ie Commuters, Transport Operators, Commercial, Private & Law enforcements, engage transparently in the Transport ecosystem, to transpose with incidents over geo-spacial data to identify hotspots bottlenecks, frustrating incidents & correlate crime with infrastructure deficiencies & advocating on infrastructure developments based on credible data.<br>
