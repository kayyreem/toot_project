    <p>Commuters Globally & SA in particular, are impacted by an alarming rate of accidents, caused by belligerent behavior (i.e. reckless, distracted & intoxicated driving, uninsured drivers etc) consequently causing fatalities on their daily commute to school, work or enroute to destinations of leisure, which pose a significant threat to transport safety & communities. Looking specifically South Africa, a significant burden placed  on the SA economy 3.29% GDP, valued at approximately R198 Billion (2021/22) in an Economy that grew by 1.9% in 2022.

    <h2>The Toot-way</h2>
    Our proposal is a A digital transport safety solution, where users use technology to "Toot" wreckless drivers out, instead of getting involved in road rage or physical confrontations.
    <br><br>
    Our Software that will serve as an intermediary agency between the following market participants/users:<br> 
    Commuters: Private vehicle owners, (Motorised & Non-motorised), Cyclers, tourists, students, public transport, disabled persons (physical & hearing), elderly persons<br>
    Commercial Automotive sector: Secondary (Parts suppliers) & Tertiary providers (Mechanic, Fleet managers, Last-mile delivery services, e-Hailing services).<br>
    Public sector: Transport & Fleet Operators <br>
    Law enforcement agencies: Coordinate local, regional & national response police & traffic responses<br>  
    <br>
    The long term goal is to feed into an advanced transport management system that can provide real-time insights on how Road Users with different interests ie Commuters, Transport Operators, Commercial, Private & Law enforcements, engage transparently in the Transport ecosystem, to transpose with incidents over geo-spacial data to curb crime, and credibly advocate on infrastructure spending.</p>
